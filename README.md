# Netflix Clone Landing Page

This is a simple Netflix-style landing page built using HTML and CSS. I created this project to practice front-end web development, focusing on layout design, responsiveness, and styling. The goal was to replicate the sleek, modern interface of Netflix while keeping the codebase clean and easy to understand.

## Features
- **Fully Responsive** â€“ The page is optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Sleek UI** â€“ Designed to mimic the clean and modern look of Netflix, with proper spacing and a structured layout.
- **Custom Fonts & Icons** â€“ Integrated Google Fonts and Font Awesome to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Overlay Effects** â€“ Includes hover effects and background overlays to improve user experience.
- **Well-Structured Code** â€“ The HTML and CSS are organized for easy readability and modifications.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** â€“ For structuring the webpage with semantic elements.
- **CSS3** â€“ For styling, layout, and animations.
- **Google Fonts** â€“ Used to improve typography and readability.
- **Font Awesome** â€“ Integrated for scalable vector icons and symbols.
- **Flexbox & Grid** â€“ Implemented for an adaptive and flexible layout design.
